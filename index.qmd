I am Postdoc at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University as a part of the ERC funded [STANDBY](https://ps.au.dk/forskning/forskningsprojekter/standby) project researching how we react as bystanders when exposed to online political hostility. I hold a PhD in Political Science from Aarhus University. I am also an affiliate of the [Research on Online Political Hostility (ROPH) Project](https://ps.au.dk/forskning/forskningsprojekter/research-on-online-political-hostility).

In my research, I examine the causes and consequences of online political hostility, including what people bring with them from their offline context in terms of psychological, sociological and political predispositions, and how it is translated into online behaviour.
